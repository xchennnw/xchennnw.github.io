# My Projects

Overview
------------
You will implement a collection of classes and functions in order to create the
foundation of a ray tracer / path tracer. You will begin by creating classes to represent
ray tracer architecture, such as a `Camera` and `Primitive`, then implement
functions to find the intersection of a ray with various surfaces.
